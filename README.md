# National and subnational estimates of the time-varying reproduction number for Covid-19

This repository contains estimates of the time-varying reproduction number for every country in the world listed in the ECDC Covid-19 data source and subnational estimates for 9 countries. Summarised estimates can be found in `national/cases/summary` and `national/deaths/summary` (based on cases and deaths respectively). Estimates for each country can be found in `national/cases/national` and `national/deaths/national`. Subnational estimates can be found in the relevant country folder (`subnational/country`) with the same folder structure as for the national estimates. Estimates are generated using [`{EpiNow2}`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/) and presented on [epiforecasts.io/covid](https://epiforecasts.io/covid) (which also outlines the method used).

If using these estimates please consider citing our associated [paper](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-112).

## Updating the estimates

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates.git
```

### Using a remote server

Run the following on the command line replacing `path-to-key`, `username@public-ip-of-server`, `github-username`, and `github-pat` with your information. *Note this is not a secure way of transferring your GitHub PAT.*

```bash
curl --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates/master/bin/update-via-ssh.sh > update-via-ssh.sh
sudo bash update-via-ssh.sh path-to-key username@public-ip-of-server github-username github-pat
```

See `bin/update-via-ssh.sh` for details on what this script is doing and the more detailed step by step instructions below.

### Using Docker

2. Log in to GitHub Docker package repository.

```bash
docker login docker.pkg.github.com
```

#### Script approach


3. (Optional - must be done at least once) Update the docker container (by default this pulls a built image passing `"build"` instead triggers a build based on local files).

```bash
sudo bash bin/update-docker.sh
```

3. Run the following in a bash terminal (see `docker logs covidrtestimates` for runtime information).

```bash
sudo bash bin/update-via-docker.sh
```

#### Step by step


3. (Optional) Build the docker container locally.

```bash
docker build . -t covidrtestimates
```

4. (Optional). Alternatively pull the built docker container.

```bash
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates/covidrtestimates:latest
docker tag docker.pkg.github.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates/covidrtestimates:latest covidrtestimates
```

5. Update the estimates (see `docker logs covidrtestimates` for runtime information).

```bash
sudo docker run -d --user rstudio --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/home/rstudio/covid-rt-estimates --name covidrtestimates covidrtestimates /bin/bash bin/update-estimates.sh
```


### Using R

2. Install dependencies.

```r
devtools::install_dev_deps()
```

3. Update national estimates.

```r
Rscript R/update-cases.R
Rscript R/update-deaths.R
```

4. Run `Rscript R/run-region-updates.R`. 

   Adding `--help` will show documentation and the command options. This can run all or some regions and subregions, control logging and exclude unstable regions. 
   
   Note: Currently regions are all country level but the region/subregion pattern could be reused on any level of parent/child geographic dataset.

## Development environment

This analysis was developed in a docker container based on the `epinow2` docker image.

To build the docker image run (from the `covid-rt-estimates` directory):

``` bash
docker build . -t covidrtestimates
```

Alternatively to use the prebuilt image first login into the GitHub package repository using your GitHub credentials (if you have not already done so) and then run the following:

```bash
# docker login docker.pkg.github.com
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates/covidrtestimates:latest
docker tag docker.pkg.github.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates/covidrtestimates:latest covidrtestimates
```
To run the docker image run:

``` bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 --name covidrtestimates -e USER=covidrtestimates -e PASSWORD=covidrtestimates covidrtestimates
```

The rstudio client can be found on port :8787 at your local machines ip.
The default username:password is covidrtestimates:covidrtestimates, set the user with -e
USER=username, and the password with - e PASSWORD=newpasswordhere. The
default is to save the analysis files into the user directory.

To mount a folder (from your current working directory - here assumed to
be `tmp`) in the docker container to your local system use the following
in the above docker run command (as given mounts the whole `covidrtestimates`
directory to `tmp`).

``` bash
--mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/tmp,target=/home/covidrtestimates
```

To access the command line run the following:

``` bash
docker exec -ti covidrtestimates bash
```
